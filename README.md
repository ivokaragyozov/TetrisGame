# Tetris

Just a simple Tetris game made in Python. Have some ideas to upgrade it in the future with some of the following functionalities:
 - draw the game over screen
 - make start menu
 - make an AI to play (maybe not in the near future)
 - add additional statistics druring gameplay for showing the number of past pieces of each type
 - add animations when clearing lines
 - music
 - include database with results
