# TetrisGame

Just a simple Tetris game made in python. Have some ideas to upgrade it in the future with some of the following improvements:
	# - draw the game over screen
	# - make start menu
	# - make an AI to play (maybe not in the near future)
	# - add additional statistics druring gameplay for showing the number of past pieces of each type
	# - add animations when clearing lines
	# - music
	# - include database with results
